# Year 2025: Accessibility — Must or Want
## A Change Is Coming
In the opening scenes of Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings*, accompanied by ominous music, we hear the words:

> The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air.

The upcoming change is encapsulated in the rather intricate title: [European Accessibility Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882)

Is there really anything to fear? Who will be affected by these changes, and who will not? And is it really just about complying because the regulations say so? Or perhaps it's worth viewing them as a prompt for reflection and action in the spirit of "I want to"?

## What will "have to be accessible"?

### Products

- Computers and operating systems,
- Payment terminals and self-service machines (ATMs, ticket machines, information kiosks),
- Consumer devices used for telecommunications and access to audiovisual services (phones, smartphones, smart TVs, etc.),
- E-book readers and their software.

### Services

- Telecommunications,
- Services accompanying passenger transport (such as websites, mobile applications, electronic tickets and their sales systems, providing information about transport services),
- Retail banking,
- Distribution of electronic books,
- E-commerce (meaning: if you sell something online, you are engaged in commerce).

Of course, the local regulations concerning public services and numerous others related to telecommunications, media, access to public utility buildings, etc., remain in force. It is also worth reviewing local implementations of the EAA.

## Are there any exemptions?

The provisions of the act will not apply to micro-enterprises. They also won't be enforced if businesses demonstrate that meeting the requirements would necessitate altering the inherent properties of a product or service, or if the costs would be disproportionately high.

It’s also important to note that non-compliant terminals (e.g., ATMs) introduced before June 2025 can remain in use for up to 20 years from the start of their operation. The act also allows a five-year transition period for adapting services.

In other words, the change won't affect everyone equally or at the same pace.

For those resistant to change, penalties await, such as withdrawing products from the market, suspending the ability to offer and provide services, or financial penalties — all for failing to meet “accessibility requirements.”

Yes, the same accessibility often likened to a [monster](https://blog.mooncascade.com/10-ux-monsters-that-designers-fear-and-how-to-overcome-them/). The one that "meddles" with designers' color schemes and the subtle compositions of pages and products. It peeks under the frontend hood and points fingers at lines of code that don't sit well with it. It stirs things up for product people in their tasks and backlogs. And as for quality assurance specialists... Honestly, I get the sense that QA folks quite like accessibility.

## What is accessibility in the new regulations?
The European Accessibility Act refers to universal design, as mentioned in the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/convention/convoptprot-e.pdf):

>“Universal design” means the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

**Principle 1 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 1:

	1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.
	1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
	1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.
	1d. Make the design appealing to all users.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

**Principle 2 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 2:

	2a. Provide choice in methods of use.
	2b. Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.
	2c. Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
	2d. Provide adaptability to the user's pace.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

**Principle 3 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 3:

	3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
	3b. Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
	3c. Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
	3d. Arrange information consistent with its importance.
	3e. Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

**Principle 4 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 4:

	4a. Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.
	4b. Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.
	4c. Maximize "legibility" of essential information.
	4d. Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).
	4e. Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

**Principle 5 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 5:

	5a. Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.
	5b. Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
	5c. Provide fail safe features.
	5d. Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

**Principle 6 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 6:

	6a. Allow user to maintain a neutral body position.
	6b. Use reasonable operating forces.
	6c. Minimize repetitive actions.
	6d. Minimize sustained physical effort.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.

**Principle 7 Guidelines**
The following guidelines underpin Principle 7:

	7a. Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user.
	7b. Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.
	7c. Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.
	7d. Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.

Additionally, the EAA defines specific criteria for particular groups of products and services. Meeting these criteria indicates compliance with accessibility requirements. A helpful resource for expanding knowledge in this area is the [EN 301 549 Accessibility Standard, version 3.2.1.](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf)

## Who is this accessibility for?

Do you know where this quote comes from?

>We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
>
>We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

It is not a document or a manifesto from accessibility specialists. It was written in 1996 (nearly 30 years ago) by John Perry Barlow. It’s called [A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence). One of the foundations of freedom in cyberspace was meant to be the equality of its users. Is that the case? (Hint: [not really...]([Digital Trust Index](https://www.digitaltrustindex.eu/#main-content)))

Now, let me invite you to a simple exercise. Think about whether you’ve ever experienced any of the following:

- [] You had to ask someone to repeat something because you didn’t hear it clearly.
- [] Searching for something took a lot of time because you didn’t have your glasses on.
- [] You were so upset by something that you couldn’t focus on anything else.
- [] The sound on your computer wasn’t working (hello, Andrew, we can see you, but we can’t hear you...).
- [] You tried to withdraw money from an ATM with a touch interface, but bright sunlight made it unreadable.
- [] Your hands were full, and getting through non-automatic doors turned into a bit of gymnastics.
- [] You had to reread the same sentence several times, wondering why you couldn’t make sense of it.
- [] You couldn’t get the display on a second monitor or projector to show, no matter what you did.
- [] A terrible cold robbed you of the pleasure of eating what was supposed to be a great meal at a restaurant.
- [] Sadness clouded your thoughts and made it hard to focus.
- [] A form was so confusing or filled with errors that you couldn’t complete it or get what you needed from it.
- [] For any reason (too little money, being too tall, too short, too well-dressed, too casually dressed, too young, too old...), you couldn’t do something you really wanted to do.

You might also reflect on other challenges you’ve faced in everyday life, especially in the context of the "digital space."

Now, about accessibility. Sometimes, I feel (and I hope it’s only a feeling) that it’s treated—both in the digital and non-digital realms—like blue parking spaces (in Poland, this color is used to designate parking spaces for persons with disabilities). A necessary evil (because regulations). Created for a narrow group of people (because you need a disability parking permit). Consuming time and money (two regular parking spaces could fit here, plus all that paint and extra signage). Yet, strangely enough, when "something important comes up," or "just for a moment," or if life hasn’t been particularly kind and something happens, these spaces suddenly become desirable. Everyone would prefer them to be available for all.

While it’s not feasible to make blue parking spaces available to everyone, accessibility can indeed become a universal good. Especially if we think about it from the very beginning of designing objects, buildings, architectural solutions, websites, applications, services, and so on.

The foundation doesn’t have to be legal regulations. Of course, it’s great when they exist because they enforce consideration for accessibility and provide a benchmark for what we create. They also ensure that market participants start on relatively equal footing. But it’s far better when the basis for caring about accessibility comes from willingness, supported by an awareness of exclusion—or, as Kat Holmes called it in her book, mismatches. [Mismatch. How Inclusion Shapes Design](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539487/mismatch/).

This earlier exercise was meant to highlight how exclusions, or "mismatches," can affect us all at some point. These mismatches occur when a barrier prevents someone from accomplishing what they intend to do.

Such barriers can stem from:

- **Permanent factors**: often linked to disabilities or neurodiversity.
- **Temporary factors**: like an illness or injury that is recoverable.
- **Situational factors**: a much broader category, such as forgetting your reading glasses, being in a noisy environment, or adapting to a new city.

In Poland, based on the 2021 census, over 5.4 million people (14.3%) have a disability, representing a constant exclusion factor. How do temporary and situational exclusions compare? It’s hard to calculate precisely, but some estimates give perspective.

For instance, Microsoft, while developing its [Inclusive Design Framework](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/), analyzed [U.S. data](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/InclusiveDesignForCognitionGuidebook.pdf):

- Around **26,000 people annually lose an arm below the elbow**.
- Injuries like hand fractures or sprains affect an additional **13 million people annually**.
- Situational exclusions, such as carrying items that limit hand use, impact **8 million people annually**.

When put into context, with a U.S. population of 333.3 million, the scale of people experiencing some form of mismatch—be it permanent, temporary, or situational—is enormous. These figures demonstrate that inclusivity is not a niche concern but a mainstream necessity.

The 2003 Microsoft report, [*The Wide Range of Abilities and Its Impact on Computer Technology*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18446), highlighted a critical yet often overlooked issue: nearly 78% of users experience varying degrees of difficulty with computers and digital solutions—ranging from minor to severe challenges.

A key conclusion from this report was that:

- In the **18–64 age group, 38% of individuals** would benefit from accessibility solutions,
- And **22% would benefit significantly**.
This adds up to 60% of the adult population that could benefit from better accessibility.

Using the metaphor of blue parking spaces: if we view accessibility as analogous to providing such spaces for those who need them, thinking ahead and planning for inclusivity is essential. If organizations and businesses fail to anticipate and address these needs proactively, they risk facing significant challenges later—financial, operational, and reputational.

Adapting to accessibility mandates only when legally required or under pressure is like realizing too late that the parking infrastructure is insufficient. Retrofitting solutions often costs more time and resources than designing inclusively from the outset.

Investing in accessibility isn’t just about compliance—it’s about foresight. It prepares businesses to serve a broader audience, increases user satisfaction, and ultimately boosts market reach. And importantly, it’s the ethical thing to do. No business wants to wake up, as you aptly put it, *finding themselves in hot water* when the costs and consequences of inaction become glaringly apparent.

## Create Solutions for the Present and Future "Us"

Business is business, but how does this translate to us?

Even if we are kings of our lives now—young, building our careers, with plans for the future—the fact remains that we are aging, and nothing will change that. We can rely on new medications, assistive solutions, and support systems. But still, sooner or later, our bodies and minds will begin to work against us. Once we pass the age of 50, we enter a group where the likelihood of experiencing permanent disability doubles compared to those aged 40-49 [Data for Poland](https://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/zdrowie/zdrowie/stan-zdrowia-ludnosci-polski-w-2019-r-,26,1.html).

How well we cope with this will largely depend on the solutions we create today. Because it’s worth thinking now about what we might need when things aren’t quite like they are today. To reflect, build awareness of the needs of those who are already at the place where we’ll be in a few years.

One can hope that the mythical "someone" will come along and fix things. But if we are involved, at various stages, in creating products and services, the practices we establish and leave behind will influence the future shape of these things. And thus, the development of accessibility—or the lack thereof.

This development largely depends on the scale of adoption of solutions that support accessibility. Once they become a permanent fixture in the commercial world, it will be difficult for inaccessible solutions to survive in the market. People will simply "vote with their feet," choosing what does not exclude them. This is already happening, as mentioned by visually impaired blogger [Glen Turner](https://welleyenever.com/about/) during a panel discussion at CXcon by Inviqa. When asked about adapting the digital world to the needs of the visually impaired community, he [said](https://youtu.be/GTRFZYEh-NY?si=58NnnMBL8Yh2NrjW&t=728):

> Again it's down to lack of awareness basically.
> I think businesses don't consult with disabled people. They either don't realise they have to do things or they don't know what they can do. 
> Some people are just dismissive and say disabled people haven't complained so there isn't an issue, where as the reality is we haven't complained because we have just gone somewhere else.
> Some people think, some businesses think they have done enough because they have done some kind of automated test online that says you haven't got decriptive text on your images and labels on your forms so as long as we fix those things that the automated test told us about then that is surely enough.
> It's not.
> Spell check is great in Word when you are typing up a novel, but that doesn't mean your novel is any good.
> I think they need to really engage with us more to find out what we need and engage with a wide range of people to get a good spectrum of what people need.
> All of us are different, even those of us in the visual impairment community all have varying needs. 

If we take a global perspective on the spectrum of permanent exclusions, based on available data, it looks like this:

1. Over 49 million people (0.6%) are blind, and 255 million (3.2%) have vision problems. (Sources: [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(17)30393-5/fulltext), [IOVS](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/))
- Maybe you already wear glasses or feel you should? Are the letters in your mobile app interface getting too small? Is it hard for you to read information on insufficiently contrasted backgrounds? 

2. Between 300 and 350 million people (3.8-4.4%) have color vision disorders. These conditions can also be acquired, such as due to complications from diabetes, lens aging (becoming thicker and yellowing), or brain injuries. (Sources: [Colorblind People Population!](**[https://www.colorblindguide.com/feed/page/3](https://www.colorblindguide.com/feed/page/3)**), [Clinton Eye Center:]( https://clintoneye.com/services/color-blindness/))
- What if your phone or computer screen struggles with color reproduction or display? 

3. 70 million of us (0.9%) are deaf, and 1.5 billion (18.8%) have hearing problems. Here’s an important note: for some individuals born deaf, auditory languages (e.g., Polish, English) along with their visual written forms are foreign languages. The native language is sign language (e.g., Polish Sign Language). This adds another layer of exclusion. Thus, subtitles in films or communicating via writing may not always solve their problems. (Sources: [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health), [World Bank report on disability](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/665131468331271288/pdf/627830WP0World00PUBLIC00BOX361491B0.pdf))
- Do you also struggle to hear what others are saying? For example, due to chronic nasal congestion affecting your ears, or when your Bluetooth headphones are out of battery and you can’t listen to music? Not to mention trying to have a conversation on a busy intersection. 

4. Over one billion people (more than 12.5%) suffer from mobility, fitness, and bodily structure disabilities. (Sources: [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health), [World Bank report on disability](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/665131468331271288/pdf/627830WP0World00PUBLIC00BOX361491B0.pdf))
- Pain from prolonged effort, injuries, infections, or even simple fatigue can suddenly decrease your endurance. What if you’re carrying something with both hands, or are forced to work for an extended period in a squatting or kneeling position?

5. Around 3.4 billion people globally (about 43%!) permanently experience neurological and cognitive issues. These range from nervous system injuries, neurological disorders, to depression and neurodivergence. (Source: [The Lancet Neurology](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(24)00038-3/fulltext))
- Deep sadness (e.g., grief), agitation, euphoria, sleep deprivation, the effects of intoxicants, and substance use also impact your cognitive abilities.

The above overview isn’t intended to scare anyone. Rather, it’s meant to encourage reflection and consideration of how the solutions we design, code, and manage might exclude people and create barriers.

Universal design can be integrated into the entire lifecycle of creating and managing these solutions. But it will only work if the integration is holistic and applies to nearly every activity of the product team. It’s important to discard the myth of the accessibility “warrior,” someone who rides in on a white horse, bringing accessibility and shining a light on others from atop their steed.

Am I exaggerating? Maybe a bit, but I’ve witnessed how the creation of roles like “accessibility advocate” or “inclusion champion” often ended up the same way UX was once perceived. Toward the end of a project, someone would remember to approach the designers and ask for a “potato stamp,” confirming that the solution was user-friendly. And perhaps tweaking some colors. Now, it’s a request for confirmation of accessibility, or possibly minor, low-effort adjustments that would make the solution more accessible or user-friendly.

## Accessibility as a Shared Effort – or, if you prefer, a Team Sport.


>Love, love is a verb
>Love is a doing word
>
>Massive Attack, Teardrop 

Love is a verb, love is an action, as the lyrics of the song Teardrop by Massive Attack say (you might know it from the opening credits of *House M.D.*). Similarly, accessibility is a verb, an action, a process. It is also a goal that we can work towards, supported by design methods like universal or inclusive design, good practices like writing clean, semantic code, and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (the often controversial WCAG). And then... there are the legal regulations, which can be seen as a compulsion (which they are), or as a benchmark or challenge.

But most importantly: CREATE YOUR PRODUCTS WITH PEOPLE. Invite different users to discuss their needs and problems, and to test your solutions and concepts as early as possible. If you're afraid to test with people with disabilities, look for companies that can do this for you. Also, take a look around. Maybe there are such people in your organization, and they will be willing to work with you.

Build teams of people who are aware of the need to care for accessibility and have the knowledge and skills to do so. Below is an example of how tasks can be divided within such a team (you can find additional resources here: [Accessibility for teams](https://digital.gov/guides/accessibility-for-teams/))

Important note
This division is not meant to draw rigid lines between roles in the team and say: don't touch, that's my responsibility. So, take a look at the descriptions and resources for each of the mentioned roles. I have a feeling, bordering on certainty, that you will find a lot for yourself there, and sharing knowledge and experience will likely help you rather than harm.

If this is your first encounter with accessibility, consider completing one of the free courses:

- [Digital Accessibility Foundations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/) - created by WAI, the creators of WCAG
- [Web Accessibility](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891) - basics of creating accessible websites
- [Microsoft Accessibility fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/accessibility-fundamental/) - a material created by Microsoft covering various topics (also about accessible AI)

### Those Who Manage (Product/Project Manager/Owner)

- Ensure time for work related to inclusivity/accessibility/usability (research, testing, workshops).
- Provide the whole team with access to documents outlining accessibility requirements and best practices.
- Foster the development of your own knowledge in this area.
- Introduce usability/accessibility testing as a standard in product testing and the *definition of done*.
- Treat usability/accessibility issues like any other product defects (prioritize them accordingly and ensure their resolution).
- Create accessibility stakeholder maps for your product.
#### What can help you?
Start with an accessibility strategy — you can find an interesting one [here](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/accessibility-strategy/).
If you want to better understand the impact of products/services on end users, use frameworks like [Consequence scanning](https://doteveryone.org.uk/project/consequence-scanning/) or [Layers of Effect](https://www.designethically.com/layers). For those who enjoy more informal methods, workshop cards like [The Tarot Cards of Tech](https://tarotcardsoftech.artefactgroup.com/) are available.

### Those Who Program and Those Who Take Care of Quality (Dev Team / Quality Assurance)

- Apply the principles outlined in the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/p) as accessibility benchmarks (if your company is subject to accessibility regulations related to the public sector or the Accessibility Act, you must do this).
- If the solution you're developing allows for content input and editing (e.g., CMS solutions, No-Code tools, Social Media tools, etc.), make sure to familiarize yourself with [ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/p).
- Maintain code accuracy and cleanliness by following best practices for [Accessibility and the Semantic Web]([Accessibility and the Semantic Web Series' Articles - DEV Community](https://dev.to/kenbellows/series/763)) – if you're using UI frameworks, take a look at this study on the accessibility of various front-end solutions: [The state of accessible web UI frameworks (darekkay.com)](https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-ui-frameworks/)
- Stay in constant communication with designers – pay attention to UI solutions that require overly complicated code and may cause issues for alternative access methods (e.g., keyboard-only navigation or screen readers).
- Test for accessibility and usability: Integrate accessibility testing into your regular testing cycles. Perform automated and manual tests to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.
- Ensure compatibility: Make sure the product works across various platforms, browsers, and devices, paying special attention to screen readers and other assistive tools.
- Monitor and fix accessibility issues: Treat accessibility issues as defects, prioritize their resolution, and fix them in a timely manner.
- Document best practices: Contribute to documentation of best practices for coding and testing accessible and inclusive digital products.
#### What can help you?

If the mere mention of WCAG gives you a rash, start with the text [WCAG, but in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand), or browse this (non) checklist [Accessibility Not-Checklist | Brewed by team Intopia](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/). Then, read about why each requirement was created, how to understand it, and how to meet it: [Understanding WCAG 2.2 | WAI | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/). If you're struggling to navigate the guidelines and requirements, the [mapa WCAG 2.2](https://www.andrewhick.com/accessibility/wcag-map/) might help.

For polish-speaking testers, a great resource is the [accessibility testing knowledge compendium](https://www.gov.pl/web/dostepnosc-cyfrowa/badania-i-testy-dostepnosci-cyfrowej) (including mobile apps) prepared by the gov.pl team or a [similar publication](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility) from the UK gov. The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has also compiled a [list of various accessibility evaluation tools(https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/)], with helpful guidance on what you might need [Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/selecting/).

[Google Accessibility Scanner](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6376570) is a tool for testing Android apps, and for Apple Xcode users, there's [Accessibility Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-inspector).

A lot of useful resources can also be found in the [IBM Equal Access Toolkit – IBM Accessibility](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit).

To quickly and preliminarily test the accessibility of websites, you can use plugins or perform quick accessibility checks (the list below provides different ways of presenting knowledge about tests and approaches, though the actual tests may repeat in the linked materials):

- [Basic screen reader commands for accessibility testing - TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/basic-screen-reader-commands-for-accessibility-testing/)

Another way to do an initial accessibility review is by going through a checklist tied to accessibility heuristics: [10 heuristics of accessibility](https://www.deque.com/blog/supporting-the-design-phase-with-accessibility-heuristics-evaluations/), [Intro to Accessibility Heuristics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQjFN3mmccM).

Don't forget to test with people who experience exclusion. Why can't you rely solely on automated validators? Once, a person set out to create the most inaccessible site that would get the maximum points in automatic validation...

### Those who design (UX, UI, Content Creators)

- Focus on the holistic user experience, not just a single page or application. People use your products and solutions as tools to accomplish tasks or goals. Often, what you deliver is just one step in a broader journey. Understanding this wider context—where users come from and where they go afterward—is crucial to avoid creating "accessible facades."
Example: A telecommunications service company had a highly accessible website but relied on follow-up phone calls for customer communication. This excluded people who are deaf, hard of hearing, uncomfortable with phone conversations, or hesitant to answer unknown numbers. Accessibility is more than just passing an audit; it's about real usability.
- Use WCAG as a foundational benchmark for your designs (recommended resource: [Accessibility Not-Checklist | Brewed by team Intopia](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/)).
- Ensure visual accessibility by maintaining proper contrasts, using accessible color schemes, and highlighting links using more than just color.
- Make link texts contextual and meaningful, so users understand their purpose even when links are out of context (e.g., "Learn more about accessibility" instead of "Click here").
- Design layouts for comfortable visual consumption, ensuring clarity and hierarchy in content presentation.
- Write clear and simple content, using language and structure accessible to people with diverse cognitive abilities.
- Prioritize simplicity in design, avoiding unnecessary embellishments, overly complex layouts, or distracting animations.
- Choose fonts that enhance readability and use them sparingly. For evidence-based guidance, consult these resources:

#### What can help you?

##### Research with People

I know I might be repeating myself, but building awareness about your users is crucial.

Looking at the design process through the lens of one of the most popular approaches, the [Double Diamond](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/), a quick reflection on accessibility can reveal how easily it might turn into what Per Axbom has termed the [Trouble Diamond](https://axbom.com/trouble-diamond/).

There’s a widespread myth that accessibility is costly. However, it’s not entirely a myth—accessibility can indeed be expensive, particularly when it's overlooked in the early stages of creating a product or solution.

- **Whom haven’t we spoken to and what haven’t we considered during the discovery phase?**
- **Which needs did we fail to understand, and where did we lack awareness of exclusion during the define phase?**
- **What didn’t we communicate to the product team during the develop phase, and who are we ultimately excluding during the deliver phase?**

Exclusion starts when we design solutions for a world that fits within the reach of our own hands, interpreting the four pillars of accessibility through our personal experiences.

Here’s what I mean by the pillars, or the primary principles of accessible design:

###### For Accessibility Beyond the Digital Realm

**Perceivability** 
Ensure everyone can engage with the design regardless of their sensory abilities. Key guidelines to enhance perceivability include:  
- Presenting information using complementary encoding methods (e.g., text, icons, and tactile).  
- Ensuring compatibility with sensory assistive technologies (e.g., ALT tags for online images).  
- Positioning information so users, whether seated or standing, can perceive it.

**Operability**  
Allow everyone to interact with the design, regardless of their physical abilities. Guidelines to improve operability include:  
- Minimizing repetitive actions and sustained physical effort.  
- Making controls easier to use by leveraging familiar patterns.  
- Ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies (e.g., wheelchair accessibility).  
- Ensuring information placement is reachable for both seated and standing users.

**Simplicity**  
Simplicity is achieved when anyone can easily understand and use the design, irrespective of experience, literacy, or focus. Guidelines for enhancing simplicity include:  
- Removing unnecessary complexity.  
- Clearly and consistently labeling controls and modes.  
- Using progressive disclosure to show only relevant information and controls.  
- Providing clear cues and feedback for all actions.  
- Ensuring the communication of information caters to a broad range of literacy levels.

**Forgiveness (Error Tolerance)** 
Designs should minimize the occurrence and consequences of errors. Guidelines include:  
- Employing proper affordances and constraints (e.g., controls that only work correctly).  
- Using confirmations and warnings to reduce errors.  
- Enabling undo actions.  
- Implementing safeguards to minimize the impact of mistakes (e.g., providing the ability to reverse an action).

###### For Digital Accessibility

**Perceivability**  
All information and user interface elements must be presented in ways that users can perceive. Key approaches include:  
- Providing textual alternatives for non-text content (e.g., descriptions/captions for images, videos, and audio recordings).  
- Ensuring appropriate contrast between background and foreground elements.  
- Avoiding reliance on color as the sole carrier of information.  
- Allowing text resizing.  
- Providing volume control and playback options.

**Operability**
All user interface and navigation elements must be operable by the user. This can be achieved by:  
- Allowing operation of the system solely via a keyboard, without imposing time limits on key presses.  
- Giving users sufficient time to review content and use features (e.g., enabling users to resume actions after session timeouts without losing data).  
- Avoiding designs that could increase seizure risks.  
- Simplifying navigation, making it easier to locate content and orient within the site.  
- Assigning unique page titles.  
- Dividing content into sections marked by headings.  
- Using descriptive link titles that clearly indicate their destination.

**Understandability**  
Information on the site and the behavior of its interface must be understandable to the user. Key practices include:  
- Writing clear, easily comprehensible text.  
- Avoiding jargon or providing ways to clarify its meaning.  
- Preventing errors during data entry by using clear labels and instructions.  
- Validating entered data and providing feedback.  
- Supporting users in recovering from errors.  
- Allowing actions to be reversed.

**Robustness (Compatibility)**  
Website content should be robust enough to ensure it can be correctly interpreted by a wide variety of user devices and assistive technologies. If this isn’t feasible, creating an alternative version of the site that meets these criteria is recommended. A good practice is to use redundant solutions—providing seemingly "unnecessary" alternatives that enable tasks to be completed in different ways.

These four principles can be used to test products at various stages of their development:

- **During the initial research phase**, when we aim to understand and define the problem, we can conduct broad research with individuals from virtually the entire spectrum of exclusions (recommended methods: interviews, shadowing).

- **At the design stage**, when we already have solution sketches, initial mockups, or prototypes, our goal may be to verify whether the proposed solution meets the principle of understandability. User testing can be invaluable at this stage, particularly with:
  - individuals with communication challenges,
  - individuals for whom the solution’s language is not their native language,
  - individuals with dyslexia or hearing impairments.
  
  In recent years, awareness of accessibility-related needs has been growing among developers of design tools, providing new opportunities (e.g., [using prototypes from Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/7810391964695-Accessible-prototypes-in-Figma) or prototypes generated in No-Code tools for testing with screen reader users).

- If the company you work for allows testing with test code (e.g., dev versions of solutions, functionalities behind feature flags, etc.), it is possible to evaluate perceivability, operability (usability), and understandability. For these tests, consider inviting individuals who:
  - have dyslexia,
  - have hearing impairments,
  - have learning or memory challenges, ADHD, or are neurodiverse,
  - use alternative pointing devices and/or only a keyboard,
  - have vision impairments.

- Research should not end when the product is launched. At this stage, the product can undergo expert audits to verify compatibility (robustness) across various platforms and its integration with different assistive technologies (e.g., speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems, specialized controllers for individuals with advanced motor or neurological conditions, such as eye-tracking systems).

##### Awareness of Exclusion Potential

In the text [The Little Book of Accessibility](https://uxdesign.cc/the-little-book-of-accessibility-a9b59d82b412), Gareth Ford Williams incorporates a statement that has stayed with me for a long time:

>Inaccessibility is proactive, so at the beginning of a project it is important to get the team to ask the question, “who are we willing to exclude?”

It is not easy to cultivate such a conscious approach to design. Personally, I prefer to ask the question: **whom might I exclude?** Because the fact that I will exclude someone in some way is more than certain. Believing that I can always and everywhere meet everyone's needs is simply romantic thinking. It’s much better to know where my product falls short and openly communicate about it to avoid "harming" those who might mistakenly think it’s for them. But again, to know this, you have to test and verify. 

You can also start with a thought experiment called "[persona permutation](https://uxdesign.cc/your-one-size-fits-all-persona-doesnt-work-and-what-to-do-about-it-4f96a16bcdd0)." Think of it as a series of questions about what would happen if the characteristics of the people using our solution were different:

1. **Gender identity**
   - We designed for female users, but now male users come to us. Or our solution is deeply embedded in stereotypes about a particular gender.
2. **Physical/mental state or age**
   - Permanently, temporarily, or situationally, someone stops seeing, hearing, or feeling. Mobility or comprehension is limited. Anxiety, agitation, or euphoria arises. Age changes.
3. **Personal/professional life**
   - Aspirations change (e.g., due to promotions or pay raises). Financial status worsens. They move to a larger or smaller city. They become a parent or lose a loved one.
4. **Technology/environment/circumstances**
   - The operating system or device they use changes. The network connection in their location is weak. Notifications are turned off. They cannot talk or type.
5. **Knowledge/skills/qualifications**
   - The level of digital literacy changes (to very low or very high), or expertise in a given field shifts (becoming an expert or a beginner).

Will these changes improve or worsen the user’s experience? How will the way they use the product change? What additional information will be needed? What technologies will be necessary to access the product?

For such thought experiments, you can use the [Inclusive Design Canvas](https://ationcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-Kanwa-Projektowanie-inkluzywne-2024.pdf) ([here is English version of it](https://github.com/ka-er-zet/universal-design/blob/main/Inclusive_design_canvas.pdf)) and then validate the most significant risks or problems and potential solutions. You can also look for inspiration using the tool [Cards for Humanity (frog.co)](https://cardsforhumanity.frog.co/).

You can also experiment with people under relatively safe conditions within your organization. The concept of [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) involves using your product for everyday tasks. If we claim that our users can do this, why don’t we do it ourselves? For example, if we created a tool for designing APIs, why would we avoid using it for our own API? If, under unstable internet conditions, I lost my work three times, what happens to users? If a colleague testing our interface has motor difficulties and uses a keyboard, why not help them by better supporting alternative navigation methods beyond just a mouse?

##### Knowledge

Just as with our colleagues in Dev and QA teams, it's essential to become familiar with WCAG. (Links to materials can be found in the section for developers and quality assurance specialists.)

A fantastic resource for basic "dos & don'ts" principles are posters created by [UK Government](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/). Thanks to Stefan Wajda's efforts, their Polish translation is also available: [Projektowanie dla dostępności - LepszyWeb.pl](https://lepszyweb.pl/blog2/projektowanie-dla-dostepnosci).

The Canadian Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD) has created a comprehensive handbook on accessible graphic design, which also includes non-digital aspects: [RGD | AccessAbility 2: A Practical Handbook on Accessible Graphic Design](https://rgd.ca/working-in-design/resources/accessability-2-a-practical-handbook-on-accessible-graphic-design).

There are many books offering insights into the experiences of people facing exclusion. Below is a personal selection of Polish books—not an exhaustive list but rather a "tasting menu" to whet your appetite for more.

1. **"Duże sprawy w małych głowach"** by Agnieszka Kossowska
   - This book, ostensibly for children, introduces the world of human diversity and challenges in an engaging way. It’s filled with exercises that help readers understand different perspectives. Beyond the [printed book](https://bialaplama.pl/dla-dzieci/24-duze-sprawy-w-malych-glowach) (which sells out quickly), there are [signbook videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@duzesprawywmaychgowach4551/videos) and [lesson plans](https://bialaplama.pl/img/pdf/scenariusze-wychowanie-do-nauczania-wlaczajacego.pdf) for inclusive education.

2. **"Głusza"** by Anna Goc
   - A must-read for those seeking to understand the world of Deaf individuals. Be warned: it’s deeply moving and hard to forget.

3. **"Synu, jesteś kotem"** by Katarzyna Michalczak
   - This book explores neurodiversity through the lens of a parent of a child on the autism spectrum. It’s a fascinating look at how individuals connected to excluded persons—through care, work, or relationships—can experience exclusion themselves.

4. **"Nie przywitam się z państwem na ulicy. Szkic o doświadczaniu niepełnosprawności"** by Maria Reiman
   - A short but impactful book in which the author, who had a disability herself, speaks with other women born with Turner syndrome. It highlights the diverse ways individuals can experience the same condition.

5. **"Nie widzę przeszkód"** by Marcin Ryszka and Jakub Białek
   - An active blind individual shares their perspective on life, challenges, and triumphs.

For a broader perspective, check out Stella Young's excellent TED Talk: [“I’m not your inspiration, thank you very much”](https://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much/transcript). It’s an important reminder to avoid falling into the trap of the [charity model of disability](https://aco.institute/2023/07/16/theoretical-models-of-disabilities-part-7-understanding-the-charity-model-of-disability/). If theoretical models of disability intrigue you, you’ll find articles on the topic at the [Aco Institute](https://aco.institute/?s=Theoretical+Models).

## Why You Might Want to Care About Accessibility

After scaring you with laws (hopefully only effectively in terms of encouraging you to gain knowledge and start addressing the topic, rather than causing decision paralysis), it's time to offer some information on why being accessible is truly important. And I mean, seriously important.

Let's take a look at the world of game development. There are no regulations, no top-down guidelines, yet there’s a lot of inspiration about how to make sure people are included.  
[Xbox Adaptive Controller](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller?msockid=2bc0af3ae9a16d140fa0bc3ce8b36c84) and [Project Leonardo](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/01/04/introducing-project-leonardo-for-playstation-5-a-highly-customizable-accessibility-controller-kit/#:~:text=Project%20Leonardo%20for%20PS5%20is%20a%20canvas%20for%20gamers%20to) for Playstation are two of the best-known examples of hardware solutions supporting people with special needs.  

There are also "systemic" solutions encouraging developers and creators to implement assistive solutions at the code level, while also informing potential players about how a title can adapt to their needs. Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing this type of communication about accessibility features, such as with the [Accessibility Feature Tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/accessibility-feature-tags).

How did the game dev world do it? You might ask. Very simply. Microsoft, Sony, and some studios employ people with disabilities. These people are the driving force behind change, following the principle: "nothing about us, without us."

[August de los Reyes](https://www.fastcompany.com/90590698/inclusive-design-pioneer-august-de-los-reyes-dies-of-covid-19-complications), responsible for accessibility on the Xbox platform (you can read more about his work in the book "User Friendly: How Invisible Design Rules Shape Our World"), the community focused around [AbleGamers - Combating Social Isolation Through Play](https://ablegamers.org/), and the portal [Can I Play That?](https://caniplaythat.com/).

For a while, there was a lot of excitement in the world of digital accessibility over the series *The Last of Us*. And rightly so! Read and watch:
- [The Last of Us Part I - Accessibility Trailer | PS5 Games](https://youtu.be/LINKh60I8CY?si=DCTv_cqHtSBx-1Fh)
- [Accessibility settings and options in The Last of Us Part 1 | Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/guides/23330275/the-last-of-us-part-1-accessibility-setting-list-features-customization-options)
- [Naughty Dog explains The Last of Us Part II’s ambitious accessibility features - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4)
- [The Last of Us Part 2: A blind video gamer got emotional after seeing the game’s extensive accessibility options for players with disabilities | CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility-options-blind-gamer-trnd/index.html#:~:text=When%20blind%20gamer%20Steve%20Saylor%20received%20an%20early%20review%20copy#:~:text=When%20blind%20gamer%20Steve%20Saylor%20received%20an%20early%20review%20copy)

In the world of board games, a great example is Mattel, which implements a unified language for [color description](https://www.coloradd.net/en/).

As a curiosity, it’s also worth mentioning a game that’s been approved by the FDA in the USA as a treatment aid for ADHD: [The FDA just approved the first prescription video game — it’s for kids with ADHD - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo)

But going beyond the game dev world…

When it comes to Polish commercial services market, it’s worth mentioning the initiative [Business Accessibility Forum (BAF)](https://baforum.pl/), which defines itself as a "platform uniting organizations focused on increasing the accessibility of goods and services for all Internet users." In their service, you can find a knowledge base and reports related to accessibility in the world of commercial solutions. Here you can find similar initiative: [Business Disability Forum](https://businessdisabilityforum.org.uk/resource/the-european-accessibility-act-eaa-what-businesses-need-to-know-and-do/). 

In the aforementioned [inclusive design canvas](https://ationcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-Kanwa-Projektowanie-inkluzywne-2024.pdf) ([Englis](https://github.com/ka-er-zet/universal-design/blob/main/Inclusive_design_canvas.pdf)), you can find a section about opportunities for business. In other words, how potential solutions to the problems/exclusions that people may experience can translate into the value of the product itself.

Let me briefly return to the spectrum of exclusion: permanent, temporary, and situational factors translate into quite large groups of people interested in accessibility solutions. Sometimes a single solution can address them, and sometimes we need different approaches for different problems. The simplest example is "watching a movie." Lack of vision/trouble with it: audio description; lack of hearing/trouble with it: subtitles and sign language interpretation, etc. However, usually when we address the problem of one (typically starting with permanent exclusions) group, we’re also helping other groups (for example, subtitles help when you can’t hear what someone is saying or if they speak with a difficult-to-understand accent, or they can support language learning).

Probably the most frequently mentioned example is the [The Curb Cut Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect); [Curb Cuts: A Brief History – Accessibility Digest – Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/accessibility-resources/newsletter/curb-cuts-a-brief-history/) – the effect of lowered curbs. Regulations requiring the lowering of curbs at pedestrian crossings, introduced in the USA as a result of actions by activists advocating for people with disabilities, quickly proved beneficial for:
- parents pushing strollers
- those with heavy luggage "on wheels"
- cyclists
- roller skaters and skateboarders
- people with lower limb motor issues
- and, of course, for those the curb cuts were originally designed for – wheelchair users

This is also a great example of how accessibility is an active action, a process, or even a verb. Because too smooth a transition from the sidewalk to the street became... a problem for blind people. They lost a clear feedback: you’ve stepped off the sidewalk. Thus, nowadays, curb cuts are accompanied by special tiles or blocks with bumps to warn of approaching the street's edge (which, in winter, are great for collecting snow and ice... have I mentioned that accessibility is a process?).

Let’s return to opportunities. It may turn out that, besides covering many cases (scaling well), a solution also includes our key clients. And when through it we can stand out? Is it something that the competition doesn't have yet, or is it a unique way of using what everyone already knows? Then we have a business opportunity that can’t be missed. What should we do next? Test it, consider the consequences... but that’s already been covered.

Here’s a small digression or reminder: regulations will enforce accessibility on quite a large part of the product and service market. It’s worth thinking prospectively: how will my product/service perform if it’s not accessible? Am I truly so unique that I should look for ways to bypass the regulations or enjoy the exclusions?

How does this translate into concrete numbers? How much can a business gain (or lose) if it’s not good at accessibility? Or if it overlooks the opportunities?

According to the **[E-Commerce in Poland 2022](https://pbi.org.pl/patronaty/raport-e-commerce-w-polsce-2022-juz-dostepny/)** report, the value of the Polish e-commerce market is 124 billion PLN, and 63% of online buyers are in the age groups 35-49 and 50+. Remember? They won’t be younger. I’ll remind you again, according to GUS, that the percentage of people in the 50-59 age group experiencing disabilities increases by a factor of two (!) (compared to the 40-49 age group). Now, calculate where the money lies...

Interesting data can also be found in the BAF report "[Digital Accessibility in Polish Business 2023](https://www.baforum.pl/2023/strona-glowna)"

In the [**Digital accessibility: achieving great CX for all**](https://inviqa.com/sites/default/files/2020-03/Inviqa-Digital-Accessibility-Report-2020.pdf) report, Inviqa presents data for the UK market related to the shopping activity of people with disabilities:
- In terms of the "pie to be divided," it’s 274 billion pounds
- Businesses that fail to meet the needs of people with disabilities can lose 420 million pounds... every week
- Moreover – when companies fail these customers, most of them decide to abandon their purchase (71%) or find another company with a more accessible website (48%)
- Ensuring accessibility and usability improves the product for about 20% of potential customers
- 82% of customers experiencing exclusion would spend more if the site were more accessible
- Designing and implementing with accessibility in mind is cheaper than “adding” it to a finished product

To complement the issue of thinking about accessibility and usability from the start, it's worth referring to the [summary prepared by Future Mind](https://www.futuremind.com/insights/business-case-ux-research):
- You can save 50% of development time when user needs are well defined
- UI work accounts for 47-66% of the total project code, 40% of the development team’s time, and about 80% of unforeseen fixes (the rest are errors)

Focusing on accessibility also opens products up to thinking about alternative uses or simple improvements that expand the market of users.

>...phonograph books, which will speak to blind people without effort on their part...

The idea of creating audiobooks for deaf individuals appeared in... 1877 in the [Tin Foil Phonograph patent application](https://www.loc.gov/collections/edison-company-motion-pictures-and-sound-recordings/articles-and-essays/history-of-edison-sound-recordings/history-of-the-cylinder-phonograph/) – a device by Thomas Edison that could not only play but also record sound onto metal cylinders. Since 1934, the USA has had a program called "Books for the Blind (Talking Books)." Today, it's still evolving, for example, as a so-called skill for Alexa called "[My talking books](https://www.loc.gov/nls/how-to-enroll/sign-up-for-bard-and-bard-mobile/welcome-to-my-talking-books/)". And by the way, who among us hasn’t used audiobooks? :)

The Citroen TUB/TUC (1939) was the first delivery van to solve the problem of unloading goods in narrow streets by using sliding doors. Today, this solution is common in family cars but also in solutions for drivers with disabilities.

IKEA, [introduced in the Israeli market](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261893/ikea-thisables-3d-printed-add-ons-people-with-disabilities) the concept of IKEA [ThisAbles](https://web.archive.org/web/20210923123542/https://thisables.com/new-developments/) – 3D-printable add-ons to their popular furniture and solutions. Add-ons that enhance usability and accessibility.

And there’s more:
- OXO Good Grips kitchen tools – designed with people with manual limitations, such as those with arthritis, in mind. Ergonomic handles with a soft coating are easy to grip, even when hands are wet, making them comfortable not only for people with disabilities but for all users.
- Levi’s "Adaptive" jeans – a clothing line designed for people with disabilities, with easier-to-fast zippers, magnets instead of buttons, and stretchy fits that allow for easier dressing for wheelchair users.
- Gillette Treo Razor – specifically designed for people who need help shaving. It’s a product intended for caregivers, allowing easier and safer shaving for elderly or disabled individuals.
- Lego Braille Bricks – designed to support learning the Braille alphabet among blind and visually impaired children. The bricks are fully compatible with traditional Lego sets, enabling children with various needs to play together. Lego also promotes diversity by including figurines of disabled individuals in its sets.
- Garmin Smartwatches: a series with features for people with disabilities – these models offer health and activity monitoring functions that are tailored to the needs of people with limited mobility.

The market is already changing, and legal changes will likely accelerate these changes. Where would you like to be? As a business owner, developer, tester, or designer?

I hope that now you have the beginnings of an awareness of these changes and the possibilities of participating in them.
